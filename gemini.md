# Vivencia — The School Skill Partner

## Overview
Build a clean, professional, and minimalist multi-page website for **Vivencia**, an education company that partners with schools to implement NEP 2020-mandated skill programs. The website should feel trustworthy, modern, and premium — targeting school principals, management, and education decision-makers in India.

## Brand Identity

Orange:            #F5921E  (accent — secondary buttons, highlights, badges)
Pink:              #E94980  (accent — tertiary highlights, decorative elements)

- **Body:** "DM Sans" — regular, 400 weight
- **Accent/Labels:** "DM Sans" — medium, 500 weight
- Keep font sizes generous for readability. Hero headlines should be large and impactful.

### Design Principles
- **Clean & Minimalist:** Ample whitespace, no clutter, no decorative noise
- **Professional & Trustworthy:** This targets school management — not students. The tone is corporate-education, not playful.
- **The 3 accent colors (cyan, orange, pink) are ONLY for:** borders, buttons, underlines, small accent bars, icon backgrounds, card top-borders, hover states, badges. They should NOT be used as large background fills or full-section backgrounds.
- **Backgrounds:** White (#FFFFFF) and off-white (#F8F9FC) alternating sections only
- **Subtle depth:** Use soft box-shadows on cards, no harsh gradients
- **Animations:** Minimal — subtle fade-in on scroll, smooth hover transitions on buttons/cards. No flashy effects.

## Important Notes
- This is an **informational/corporate website**, not a student-facing app. Tone is professional and clean.
- No stock images needed — the design relies on typography, whitespace, and clean layout.
- The 3 accent colors (cyan, orange, pink) should feel like subtle highlights — NOT dominant. Navy is the primary brand color.
- Every page should have a clear CTA leading to the Contact/Partner page.
- The master positioning line to use across the site: "Vivencia is The School Skill Partner that makes schools NEP 2020–ready — end-to-end, without burdening teachers."
